                <p>Thank your for stopping by my <em>Website</em>. This website will be used as a <strong>reference</strong> for future websites that I create in <strong>Professor Wolfe's Computer Science 106: The Joy of Programming Section 2: Spring Semester at 2pm on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday.</strong> 
                    This is my portfolio that I will be updating as I progress through this class and add in elements to show case the skills and knowledge that I have obtained thoughout the semester. Most of these skills are learned through Khan Academy video assigned by out teacher every week as well as 
                    guidance from the TA's and Professor Wolfe. This website is completely original and personally made photos except for the banner. Any used of the images will be deemed as copyrights. Feel free to inspect this page to learn more about my process and coding to obtain this master piece. 
                    Learn more about the projects and creation I have created in the Javascript tab or the about me tab to learn more well... About me. </p>
